Overall, Iâ€™ve given this show a perfect 10/10 rating on IMDb. However, my ratings fluctuate season by season because I have a love-hate relationship with some of the storylines and characters they introduce over time. In particular, there are certain men who I believe are the best fit for the two main characters, Lorelai and Rory, while others have changed them for the worse.

Initially, the show had a light-hearted vibe and a strong bond between mother and daughter. However, as the series progressed, the dynamic between them began to change at times, leading to a significant falling out in season 6, which was one of my least favorite storylines. This felt like they needed something to add, so they decided to go all out with the addition, which upset many fans.
