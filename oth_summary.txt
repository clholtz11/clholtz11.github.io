This series follows the eventful lives of some high school kids in Tree Hill, a small but not too quiet town in North Carolina. The town’s greatest source of pride is its high school basketball team, the Ravens, which has been coached by the legendary Whitey Durham since living memory.

The team’s greatest talent was Dan Scott, who now runs a successful car dealership. His two sons, Nathan Scott and Lucas Scott, are the current stars of the team. Nathan is a beautiful and popular athlete, while Lucas is a talented but troubled young man.

Dan Scott is a proud and ambitious father who pushes Nathan harder than anyone else, including the coach. However, he neglects Lucas, who is raised by his devoted mother, Karen Roe, a hard-working café owner. Karen grew up with Dan’s older brother, Keith, as a substitute father. Keith was a social reject who played basketball with street kids in a public park. He also had a passion for reading.

When an incident forces the coach to replace suspended players, Lucas soon proves himself to be a valuable asset to the team. After some time, he is accepted and develops a dynamic and ultimately good relationship with his brother. This relationship leads to a dramatic turn of events when Lucas turns on his father.

Like any teenage boys, the boys in Tree Hill have friends. One of their most significant friendships is with Peyton Sawyer, a talented musician and Haley James, a tutor and irresistible man-eater.
