Stef, a dedicated police officer, is in a committed relationship with Lena. Together, they have built a close-knit family, including Stef’s biological son, Brandon, and their adopted twins, Mariana and Jesus. 

When Lena meets Callie, a hardened survivor of foster homes, the couple initially welcomes her into their home, assuming it will be temporary. However, Callie’s blunt comments about their unconventional family dynamics deeply resonate with the twins, who grapple with their own identities. 

Amidst this, Callie uncovers a secret that could jeopardize Mariana’s safety. Brandon assists Callie in navigating the social dynamics of high school, but her frequent absences from school to meet an old friend raise concerns for Stef and Lena.
