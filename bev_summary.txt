One of the definitive shows of the 1990s, "90210" originally follows the lives of Brandon and Brenda Walsh, who both eventually leave the show, and their friends through high school and college into adulthood. In addition to making sideburns momentarily cool again during its run, the show deals with a steady stream of love triangles and other romantic entanglements, and occasionally touches on more serious issues as well.
