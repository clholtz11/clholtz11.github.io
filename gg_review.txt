Overall, Iâ€™ve given this show a perfect 10/10 rating on IMDb. However, my ratings fluctuate season by season because I have a love-hate relationship with some of the storylines and characters they introduce over time.

In particular, certain men are the best fit for the two main characters, Lorelai and Rory, while others have changed them for the worse.

Initially, the show had a light-hearted vibe and a strong bond between mother and daughter. However, as the series progressed, the dynamic between them changed at times, leading to a significant falling out in season 6, one of my least favorite storylines. This felt like they needed something to add, so they decided to go all out with the addition, which upset many fans.

SPOILER!!

If I were to break it down even more, I would have to say I particularly dislike when Lorelai and Christopher get together in the last season, end up getting married, and then divorce within a couple of months. This was absolutely ridiculous. Although many people have never been huge fans of Logan with Rory, I always felt like Dean was a crazy choice. It was when they slept together that the show began to decline more rapidly.
