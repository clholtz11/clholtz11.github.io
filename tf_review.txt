Overall, I gave this show a 9/10 on IMDb. It was a perfect blend of wholesomeness, drama, and intensity. This show delves deeply into a specific topic, the foster system and foster care in general, so viewers must approach it with an open mind and heart.

Personally, this show resonated with me because the characters faced relatable issues that were both challenging and emotionally impactful. It’s rare for me to shed tears while watching a show, but this one certainly did.

SPOILER!!

When Jude was adopted by the Adams Fosters at the end of season one, while Callie was not, I lost it. This was a pivotal moment in the show because Callie genuinely desired and needed this family. Although they eventually discovered her father’s identity (only a few episodes later), it took a while before she was adopted.

One of the most challenging aspects for me to witness in this show was the dysfunctional relationship between Brandon and Callie. I believe this is because Callie yearned for a family, and Lena and Stef seemed like an ideal match for her until she became involved with their son, leading to complications. If this hadn’t occurred, I think the family dynamics would have been significantly stronger than they ultimately became.
