Overall, I've given this show an 8/10 on IMDb. This rating is solely based on the first 5 seasons since that's how far I've made it so far. 

Currently, I liked the first couple of seasons, but it began to drop off around the end of season 4. I still really want to finish watching this show, but I needed to pause since it is so long and still in production.

SPOILER!!

I do not have any spoilers as of now, except that there was some character development with some of the cast members.
